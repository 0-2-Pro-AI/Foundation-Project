I´ve just finish a new file and push to GitHub 

But when i check it, it an empty file

So i thought it might forget the information and replay the command again,

But it announce nothing to commit, working tree clean

I asked Gemini and know that i´ve forgotten to save before adding, committing and pushing.

The app was not wrong. 

I was wrong

Remembe the process

Save-Add-Commi-Push
