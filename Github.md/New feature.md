2nd day

I´m trying basically every command that i´ve learnt yesterday and learn more about GitHub on Youtube

It´s cool that GitHub not just for the begginer but also the software company. It´s a safetest place for a team of developers collab, to push, pull, commit, roll back, basically everything.

And it´s a community that everyone share the knowledge like free code, not all the free source is bad, some of them are really impressive. It´s not necessary and complex for begginer like me

So the next few days, i will learn the foundation of computer technology is Math. Some authority online sources like Khan Academy or 3Brown1Blue
