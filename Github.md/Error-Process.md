I´ve just finish a new file and push to GitHub 

But when i check it, it an empty file

So i thought it might forget the information and replay the command again,

But it announce nothing to commit, working tree clean

I asked Gemini and know that i´ve forgotten to save before adding, committing and pushing.

The app was not wrong. 

I was wrong

Remembe the process

Save-Add-Commit-Push

Programmer often create the file name with this - in the middle to not encounter an error when commit the file that have 2 words
