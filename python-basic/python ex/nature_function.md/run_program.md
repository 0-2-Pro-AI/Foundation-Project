CPU is a chef

RAM is kitchen table

Hard Disc is storage

Apple Store / Google Play is supermarket

when you run an app (order)

it will jump on kitchen table (RAM)

from the storage (Hard Disc)

and the chef (CPU) will cook it

and serve for the customer (show for the user)

and when the customer leave (exit)

clean the kitchen table (empty RAM)

waiting for that unique customer come back again

and storage is limit, 

so if you buy so much products( intall) insupermarket (Store) 

or keep so much tools (data) in storage

it will full (out of Gyte)
