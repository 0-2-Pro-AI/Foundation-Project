function dictionary basically is use Hash Function and Modulo

first, it hashing the word into a series of number

then use that number to divide for the size of dict

then take the info put in the number of the balance

for example:

menu["pizza"]

hashing "pizza" into "123456789"

size of dict is 8

than 123456789 (mod 8) = 5

the pizza in the size number 5

And there is also many case that have the same size number so it will depend on the hash algothism to fix that problem (that where you show how good you are)
