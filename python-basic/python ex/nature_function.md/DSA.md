It´s basically the art of arranging stuff

Like with the same amount of memory(RAM), but you use the right tool or way, you can contains more info

For example: you can contain double the clothes when you arrange it compare with when you roll it up and throw in the suitcase

code: when u use int() for age, it's a waste.

cause int() can contain the value of 2^34, it's around 4 billions, and we use that to keep the number of age, the small number, that's why we need DSA
