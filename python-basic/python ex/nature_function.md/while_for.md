basically function while for use the command compare and jump

For example:

while index < 10:
    print(index)
    index = index + 1

1. this is the starting line
2. you use the index - 10, if the answer is negative
--> True, run the next code
--> False(positive), jump to the break line

Nature of while for is logic (compare True/False) and control the flow (next/trump)

in AGI, this is the base for making decision
