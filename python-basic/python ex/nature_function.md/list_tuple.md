"list and tuple" use addition and multiplication to move to the address 

The RAM basically like the series of number of address, and each element of the set present for an address and have the same space of each address

For example if the first item is the number 200, and you want to take info of the fifth one,

And each address is 4 m far away (4 bytes of RAM)

the formula would be

answer = current address + (ordens * space)
answer = 200 + (5 * 4) = 220

list is naturally a "linear functions"

y = ax + b
