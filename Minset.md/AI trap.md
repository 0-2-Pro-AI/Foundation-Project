I am in really confusing situation about tuition fees, university admission conditions, age, resident permit

So if i do manually, it´s gonna taking me tons of time to process the valid information. 

That´s why i use Gemini to summarize it for it

Yeah, and it gave me info in just 30 seconds meanwhile it can take me hours for that stuff

Finally, should i be grateful for that?

.....

No, absolutely no

AI, basically when concerning to the complex informations, it tends to assume it more than verifying

That´s why, some info is not true but they even try to create their own reason to rationalize the info

It´s provided all the info for me and i totally believed that at the first place

But luckily, i am a kind of person that loving safety so i decide to take a look of one of the information that it had provided 

Wow, it was wrong and when i asked it,

It ´ve just admitted and sincered

You shouldn´t believe in me and ought to check the info yourself

i´ve just used it to do one of the most important process of my life

It´s almost ruined at least one year of my life because of wrong admission info

And notice this, I´m using a paid AI models,

It´s the advanced model compare with the free version that most of us are using it

You can imagine how unreliable it is

So basically, it is not to bad, it´s just show that ...

Just use AI, don´t rely it
