We use Parkinson to limit the time for task

Basically you reduce your working time to concentrate in important work

Tips:

It´s even more powerful to combine 20.80 law with Parkinson law

With context of one task

You use 20.80 law to find the core problem/knowledge/subskills of it

It means, you just need to do this 20% work to solve the 80% of problem, you save your time and energy for another important task

Then you use Parkinson law to set a deadline for it

For example, i will solve this 20% problem in 15 minutes

Then you will be extremely concentrate to do it, even forget the time, cause you are running with it

And for winning, you mustn´t waste time to look it
