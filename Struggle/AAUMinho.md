hhhhhh

Today was the first day that i go to school

I need to wake up from 7 to catch the bus for class at 10

Cause the school has so many instituition 

And unluckily, my course is far away my house....

I mean another city

I have bus sick, car sick, ship sick and my transportations sick as well

So 1-hour bus driving is fucking horrible with me, and to go and come back, so it´s 2

Now i know exactly why some billionares decides to drop the university

Cause with the same amout of time and effort, they can achieve a lot more

But i am not in their situation and i know clearly my disadvantage

So i will fight with me

I bless for myself

Let´s go my man!!!!
