Today i have just discovered another one in my long problem list

I am in university of Minho, but i just apply to process the resident document for AIMA

So from the beggining of the year, i didn´t attend any class and just learn knowledge about AI myself

Cause i am not good at Portuguese 

So come to school and use time for lessons that taught by Portuguese is a type of time wasting

Why? 

Cause my goal is much further, and Portuguese is not the part of it

But i found the problem today

If AIMA asks for some exame result

And my learning process is 0

Maybe my card will be cancelled

That´s mean

My dream will be furthur than estimated

And i don´t want that

So in the next 1 month

i must learn everything about basic algorithm and programming

To do the recurso test

but it´s ok

I can do it
