The 3 big tech which i considered that would create the revolution for human being are robot, AI glass and neurolink

Robot will replace people in factory, it´s already happend and just wait to be complete. In addition, it can do any job that requires simple task, boring and repetitive like housework, weaving,...

AI glass let you free from the phone. This is what i bet for. People are the vision being, so the glass AI will win in the battle with ambiente AI and make the nearest revolution.

But the ultimate is the Neurolink of Elon Musk. It´s let you completely free of devices, even the glass AI. Cause it run by your thought, your mind and even without a screen, you still can observe a virtual space, cause it affect to your vision neuron, skip even your eyes. 

Wowww!!!
