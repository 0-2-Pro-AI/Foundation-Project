right now, the birth rate is really low

it means the dead people is more than the new born baby

the reason is the costs 

and another important thing is mindset

the woman now can build their own career 

so they marry late or stay single and enjoy the life

and high age is enemy of birth rate

you either can´t have baby

nor your baby won´t have the best ideal conditions to grow 

as consequence, the number of people will decrease every decade

and even in some countries have high rate about 1.0 like Japan, Korean, ...

their population will drop half after next 3 generations
