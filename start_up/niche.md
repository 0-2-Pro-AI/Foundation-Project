i did some research today 

i found that right now is the blow up of AI agent 

but some old-fashioned company haven´t been agressive enough with it

notably is the trucking company 

they are kind of business that massive volume but less profit

a large part of their work is paperwork

not the license ones but the boring, repetitive one 

like typing manual data, collect POD of drivers,...etc

many things that can be done automatically

so i will deep research how this industry operate
