in beginning, i want to be AI expert 

to gain significant salary and save up to do my master plan

but the brutal truth was exposed by some basic math calculations

my highest salary (cap) when i am in top 1% 

just 1 million dollars a year

it means even working in 7 magnificant companies

i just can make 10 millions in 10 years

oh shit, that´s the time trading 

it can´t get me to where i want

it can´t change the world the way i believe

so i´ve immediately shift into another plan

cause i just want to do what serves my master plan

but i still notice that the AI and technology will be the future foundation

so my new niche need to help me know more about coding 

and the most important, make more money

and for now, the transportation is the most profitable
