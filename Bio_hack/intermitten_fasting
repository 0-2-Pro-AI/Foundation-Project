I need to cook by myself 

So i face with a task that took me a lot of time and effort

that's cooking

i was wondering more than one that 

why people need to have 3 meals a day

not to mention the time and effort to choose, buy, cook and eat it

if you are rich, it will be easier 

hire a cooker or restaurant

even though, there is a lot of limit like

most of us are not rich and outdoor food is not what we should to rely

fortunately, i have found a method that save my time and effort for the more important thing

intermitten fasting

it has 2 major benefits that it makes me shiver with pleasure

firstly, we don´t need 3 meals anymore (16-8 routine)

you fast in 16 hours and you eat a big meal in the last 8 hours of the day

so, basically, it saves time, effort, and even money for a broke like me

secondly, the process of fasting make your mind more awake and sharper, 

that´s the nature of an animal

you are more alert when you are hungry

in biology, that´s because the level of insulin in your body

when you don´t eat anything in a long time, the insulin is low 

and your body will burn the fast to take energy

it helps you concentrating and control your weight.
