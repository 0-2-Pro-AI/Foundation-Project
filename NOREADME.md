Today is the fist day that i tried coding. It is just somthing simple like git add . git commit -m "name" git push but it took me like more than half of today do git clone, like there is many ways to do it from the past until now so it is quite confusing, cmd, git bash, powershell. 

Finally got that git bash is the most advanced and made 3 commit to practice. Knowing how to break line as well. Pretty cool

And it took me long time also cause i want to master the base, i did research most of the thing i did today. Like Terminal is the tool for Git communicate with GitHub, or what git-m present for (message) 

But the most interesting thing is the GitHub cloud is totally diffirent with Others like Google, Microsoft,.. cause it´s not automatically syns the new info, to protect the project, you just get the new info when you do the git pull, but until now, i didn´t have a chance to do it.

And we have some like sources control in VS code but it`s better to do manually. I´m newbie and i don´t want to rush things

That´s enough for today

4 AM. GOOD NIGHT. PEACE
