My Ielts bands is 5.0 and i know 0 about technology right now.


 But yesterday, i found an AI product that changed all my perspectives and made me so happy when i think about the future of humanity.


 It created the vision that motivated me to pursue a career in computer technology and I created this project to prove that I have the passion, drive and ability to participate in the next technological revolution.

 
 And i love a quote of Charlie Munger, a legend investor "show me the incentive and i show you the outcome".
